"""Static temporal verification via graph x DFA product construction.

Given an :class:`AgentGraph` and a :class:`CompiledMonitorRule`, this module
performs a BFS over the product of the graph's node space and the DFA state
space to detect temporal property violations *statically* — without requiring
a runtime event trace.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : AgentGraph
        The agent workflow graph to verify.
    rule : CompiledMonitorRule
        A compiled temporal monitor rule (from :mod:`agentproof.monitor.ltl`).
    event_mapper : callable, optional
        A function ``(node_id, graph) -> event_dict`` used to compute the
        DFA input symbol for each graph node.  Defaults to
        :func:`_default_event_mapper`.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A JSON-serializable result containing:
        - ``rule_id``: the rule identifier
        - ``violated``: whether a violation was found
        - ``violation_kind``: ``"bad_prefix"`` (a reachable path drives the
          DFA into a violation state) or ``"unfulfilled_obligation"`` (a
          path can terminate at an exit node while the DFA is in a
          non-accepting state — an LTLf violation at trace end), or ``None``
        - ``violation_path``: list of node IDs leading to the violation,
          or ``None`` if no violation was found
        - ``product_states_explored``: number of ``(node, dfa_state)``
          pairs explored during BFS

    Executions are modeled as *maximal* paths: finite ones ending at exit
    nodes (evaluated under LTLf) and infinite ones that never leave the
    graph (evaluated under standard LTL). Three violation mechanisms are
    covered: a reachable bad prefix, a complete trace ending in a
    non-accepting DFA state, and a reachable product cycle that stays
    non-accepting forever (an eventuality that can be postponed
    indefinitely). "Not violated" therefore means no maximal path in the
    graph can violate the property.
